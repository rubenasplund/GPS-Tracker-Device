# GPS Tracker Device

## Project
A GPS tracker device which tracks position and movement patterns on animlas or things. Then sends data through lora.

## Modules and sensors needed
* GPS module - Adafruit 746
* A display - SSD1306 SPI
* Temperature sensor - MCP9700T

## Also needed for project
* Anti aliasing filters for sampling.
* Amplifiers to amplify eventually low signals to be measurable.
* ADC with at least 8 bits.

## Extra contributions
* Low power implementation of the system.
