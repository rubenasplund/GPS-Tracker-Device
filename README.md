# HR Wristband

## Project:
A simple heart rate sensor wristband which can measure heart rate, surounding temperature, average movement speed of wearer and also make a sound when wearer are moving too slow / fast or have to high / low heart rate. Also the watch will need a display which can show a simpler menu showing time, speed, heart rate and temperature.

## Sensors / modules needed:
* Heart rate sensor.
* GPS module.
* temp sensor.
* small speaker (maybe a piezo speaker)
* A display for the watch.

## Also needed for project
* Anti aliasing filters for sampling.
* Amplifiers to amplify eventually low signals to be measurable.

## Difficulties:
* It may be difficult for everything to fit on the same place on the wrist. If that is the case we are planning on having one wristband with only the heart rate sensor in it connecting to the rest of the circuit with a cable which will be furter up on the arm.
* Also difficult to implement a map on the display showing location, we are only planning on showing average speed from multiple measurements of the GPS module.

## Extra contributions
* Some kind of low power implementation of the system.
